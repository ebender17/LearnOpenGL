/*********************************OpenGL Notes*********************************/


/*********************************Math*********************************/
Two concepts that are most essential to graphics programming: 
	Vectors 
	Matrices 
The most common usage of these concepts is for transformation.
In 3D grahpical worlds there is no such thing as a "camera." What is really being done is the world is being
moved around to create the illusion of a camera.

Using GLM for math library. The standard for OpenGL.

Projection Matrix - A way to tell our window how we want to map all our different vertices to it.

We have a mathematical representation of a 3D word, but we need to convert it to a 2D drawing. This is what 
projection matrices are used for. 


/*********************************Projection Matrices*********************************/
What does the Projection Matrix do? 
	Converts coordinates or vertex positions in our digital world into our normalized device coordinate space
	of -1 to 1. 

We convert all of the positions we have in our 2D or 3D worlds into normalized device coordinates which is basically
some type of normalized space that we can map to our window.
	- Normalized space - coordinate system between -1 and 1, left side -1, right side 1, down -1, up 1 

If you are outside of this coordinate space, the item will not be rendered on screen. 

It is a little hard to deal with normalized space, therefore projection matrices help us convert from our 
coordinate space to the normalized space. 
	If you think of 3D space, it is not easy as scaling world positions into the -1 to 1 space. 
	Perspective plays a part meaning objects closer appear larger and objects farther appear smaller. 
	The projection matrices helps convert positions to 3D space by altering positions based on the depth 
	of the object (z axis). 

Orthographic Projection - means of representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. In an orthographic view,
all objects appear at the same scale. Think about 2D games you grew up with on the GameBoy. Fixed depth. There is no 
distance from the camera. 

Perspective Projection - means of representing three-dimensional objects on a two dimensional screen. 
In the perspective view, objects which are far away are smaller than those nearby. The distance and angles are not 
preserved and parallel lines do not remain paralell. Instead, they all converge at a single point called center 
of projection or projection refernce point. 

In both orthographic and perspective projection the same thing happens, tell computer how to convert from whatever space
you are dealing with (something you define yourself) to the -1 to 1 normalized device coordinate space.


/*********************************Model View Projection Matrices*********************************/
Two other matrices that are important with the transformation of geometry when we render it on screen.
	- View Matrix (eye matrix) - way to simulate a camera ("camera view"), transform of our camera 
	- Model Matrix - way to simulate the model (the model, the vertex we are drawing) matrix, transformation of the model, transform of our object
These matrices along with the projection matrix are multipled together with each vertex position to give us the final 
position of our vertexes in the 3D or 2D world on screen. 

These matrices are usually referred to as the MVP matrix. MVP does not necessarly mean the matrices are multiplied together in this order.
	In OpenGL it should really be PVM as we deal with column major ordering
	When using row major ordering, matrices are multiplied together in MVP order.

Remember these matrices are just numbers. You do not have to have a "camera", you could multiple two model matrices. It is up to use these three 
matricies. 

To simulate a camera moving left, we move everything right. 

Summary:
Model matrix: defines position, rotation and scale of the vertices of the model in the world.
View matrix: defines position and orientation of the "camera".
Projection matrix: Maps what the "camera" sees to NDC, taking care of aspect ratio and perspective.
